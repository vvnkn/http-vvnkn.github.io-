<h1>Vivian Nguyen's CPS530 Lab 1: Technical Report</h1>

<div> My name is Vivian Nguyen. My student ID number is 500777968. </div>


The actual printout of the HTML code.

<p>How did you password protect your page (what method)?
I password protected my code by adding in HTML code found on https://www.wikihow.com/Password-Protect-a-Web-Page
I am new to HTML so the new tag I tried was <body style="background-color:powderblue;"> which turned the background powder blue.
Does your page look different in different browsers and platforms(IE/Edge/Firefox/Chrome/Safari - desktop/tablet/phone)? If yes, what are the main differences?
I spent approximately 2 hours on this lab.</p>
