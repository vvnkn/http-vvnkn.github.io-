<p>I password protected my code by adding in HTML code found <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Password-Protect-a-Web-Page">here.</a></p>

<p>I am new to HTML so the new tag I tried was <xmp><body style="background-color:powderblue;"></xmp> which turned the background powder blue. </p>

<p>Does your page look different in different browsers and platforms(IE/Edge/Firefox/Chrome/Safari - desktop/tablet/phone)? If yes, what are the main differences?</p>

<p>I spent approximately 2 hours on this lab.</p>
